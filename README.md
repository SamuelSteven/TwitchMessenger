# Twitch Messenger App
## Project Description
In this project, I'm trying to create a **Twitch-Like Messenger App**, where we can make our friends register and message each other, complete with authentication. Send texts, emojis, pictures and even delete messages. The Twitch Messenger app is built on React and Node.js using [getStream.io](https://getstream.io/).

This project is based on the **Ania Kubow** project published on youtube [**"Code with Ania Kubow"**](https://www.youtube.com/c/AniaKub%C3%B3w). So, special thanks to Ania Kubow for providing this project :)

The reason why I want to try to make this project is that apart from being an interesting project, this is also my first time creating a project related to chat streams. So, I am very excited to run this project.
